## Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site [http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/). Can you find it?

## Solution
- Open the page.
- First thing to do is to open the page HTML source code and inspect it.
In the HTML document we can find a comment containing the first part of the flag ``picoCTF{t``.
From the document we can see that the site has a JS file and a CSS file. Let's check them both.

**In the CSS File:** Found a comment containing the second part of the flag ``h4ts_4_l0``.

**In the JS File:** Found a comment ``/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */``

After a quick googling I have found out that websites can block google bots to index their site using robots.txt file, and so I've typed in ``/robots.txt`` at the end of the address.

**In** [http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/robots.txt](http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/robots.txt):

I have found the third part of the flag ``t_0f_pl4c``.

The next clue we have is that the server is an Apache server. So, from what I know, Apache servers store file configuration in a file called ``.htaccess``, so let's try to access it.
Going to [http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/.htaccess](http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/.htaccess).

Here I've found the fourth part of the flag ``3s_2_lO0k``.

Next clue: ``# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.``

I can see that the 'Store' is capitalized for some reason. I thought about DS_Store file which automatically being created by Finder. So I've typed in ``.DS_Store`` and found the last part of the flag ``_d375c750}``.

That's it! :)
